        <p class="text-content">Here we met for the <i style="font-size:1.2rem;">second</i> time. <br> <br>
            A lot of time had passed. We had both become greatly different people, we just didn't know it yet.<br> <br>
            It all seemed so effortless, like it clicked as easily and quickly as it had before.<br> <br>
            Even though you thought I was an asshole (and rightly so) I'm so grateful every day that you have me another chance. <br> <br>
            This place might not have much significance to you, to us, but I can't help but to feel grateful everytime I walk by here.

            <i>Amidst the hustle and bustle of Gran Via, <br>
            A place where we laughed and played without a care, <br>
            On a bench we sat and shared our hearts, <br>
            Let's go back and relive those joyful parts.</i>
