        <p class="text-content">Here we met for the <b>second</b> time. <br> <br>
            A lot of time had passed. We had both become <b>greatly different people</b> , we just didn't know it yet.<br> <br>
            It all seemed so <b>effortless</b>, like it clicked as easily and quickly as it had before.<br> <br>
            Even though you thought I was an asshole (and rightly so) I'm so grateful every day that <b>you gave me another chance</b>. <br> <br>
            This place might not have much significance to you, to us, but I can't help but to feel <b>grateful</b> everytime I walk by here.
